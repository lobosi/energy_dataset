# Energy Dataset

### Description

This repository consolidates multiple datasets sourced from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) into a unified structure for streamlined analysis. The primary notebook, Energy_dataset.ipynb, demonstrates the process of merging and cleaning these datasets, providing a foundational resource for data exploration and preprocessing. A full analysis using this dataset, conducted by the author, is available [here](https://github.com/lobosi/Global-Emissions-Analysis).

**Note**: I am not a climate scientist. This repository reflects my personal exploration of energy data as part of my ongoing development in data science and analytical skills.

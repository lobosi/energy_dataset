# Energy Dataset

### Description

This repository consolidates multiple datasets sourced from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) into a unified structure for streamlined analysis. The primary notebook, Energy_datset.ipynb, demonstrates the process of merging these datasets, providing a foundational resource for data exploration and preprocessing.

**Note**: I am not a climate scientist. This repository reflects my personal exploration of energy data as part of my ongoing development in data science and analytical skills.
